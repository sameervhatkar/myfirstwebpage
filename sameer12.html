<b>“A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.” —John Maxwell
It’s this wonderful thought which has been the guiding force behind Tilak Education Society’s vision of moulding students into responsible leaders of the future. Today, through our various institutes we cater to the academic needs of thousands of students from kindergarten to post graduate level. But only academic knowledge cannot produce leaders; holistic development of students is the key.
Our institutions equipped with quality infrastructure and experienced faculty try to focus upon areas of specialization, technology, professional competence and ability to adapt and excel in dynamic environment. The emphasis here is to go beyond the limits of the curriculum to provide practical knowledge and through various academic, cultural and sports events instil a sense of confidence in the individual to perform in every field at the highest level. Creating the right set of moral values, tolerance and social commitments is an integral part of our education. We believe that armed with the power of knowledge, self belief and right principles our students would be able to become leaders of tomorrow.
With the same ideals we have been adding new institutes to our fold. All this would not have been possible without the blessing of the Almighty, efforts of the principals, staff, students and support of the parents and well wishers.</b>
